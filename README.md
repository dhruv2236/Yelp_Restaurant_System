Yelp Restaurant System

-> This is the simulation of the website named Yelp. Here, the services offered by Yelp for Customers and Restaurants are achieved in this project. MySQL is used in this project as a database and is deployed on Amazon RDS. This project was mainly focused on developing a backend server using Nodejs, using Redux to maintain a single source of truth for the whole application, utilizing database connection pooling to serve the queries faster, and setting up a Kafka cluster to direct the client requests to different microservices to increase the performance.
